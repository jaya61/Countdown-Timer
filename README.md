# Countdown Timer ⏳

A simple and interactive Countdown Timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This timer allows users to select a specific date and time, counting down in real-time and displaying the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It also includes fun animations when the countdown ends.
## Features

- Select a target date and time using a datetime picker.

- Real-time countdown display: Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds.

- Responsive design that looks good on all devices.

- Clean and visually appealing UI using CSS styling.

- User-friendly alerts if no date is selected.


## How the Project Works

1. The user selects a date and time using the input field.

2. When the Start button is clicked, the JavaScript code calculates the time difference between the current time and the selected target time.

3. The countdown updates every second, showing the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

4. If the countdown reaches zero:

- A “Time’s up!” message appears.

- The body briefly shakes to alert the user.

- Timer values reset to zero.

- The message disappears after 2 seconds.

5. The code also prevents starting the countdown without selecting a date.
## Additional Features Implemented

- Shake animation for the page when time runs out.

- Flashing background animation for added visual feedback.
